My Timetable
======

## The Great Plan

1. Complete the huge timetable JSON file
2. Create a quick timetable renderer that just works (in plain JS)
3. Document the timetable format
4. Test and improve the format
5. Improve the timetable renderer, maybe make it a React.js App, make it more interactive
6. Create a in-browser timetable editor
7. Build a web-app that takes care of accounts, editing timetables, and so on.
